Hello class, and welcome to **Introduction to Power Systems**. I am your instructor for this semester.

Today, we are not just talking about circuits; we are discussing the largest, most complex machine ever built by humanity: **The Electric Grid**. Every time you flip a light switch, charge your phone, or run an air conditioner, you are tapping into a synchronized machine that spans entire continents.

Below are your lecture notes for today, divided into the conceptual framework and the mathematical justification for why the system looks the way it does.

### **Lecture Module 1: The Big Picture**

The electric power system is fundamentally a chain of energy conversion. We do not "create" energy; we convert it from primary sources (coal, wind, uranium, water) into electricity, transport it, and convert it back into useful work (light, heat, motion).

We divide the power system into four distinct stages.

#### **1. Generation (The Source)**
This is where energy conversion happens. We typically generate electricity at voltages between **11 kV and 33 kV**.
* **Synchronous Generators:** Most traditional plants (thermal, hydro, nuclear) use large spinning machines that create Alternating Current (AC).
* **Inverter-Based Resources:** Solar panels and wind turbines often use power electronics to interface with the grid.

#### **2. Transmission (The Highway)**
This is the "bulk" transfer of energy.
* **Voltage:** Stepped up to very high levels (e.g., **220 kV, 400 kV, 765 kV**).
* **Purpose:** To connect generation sites (often remote) to load centers (cities) with minimal loss.

#### **3. Distribution (The Last Mile)**
Once power reaches the city, we step the voltage down to safer levels.
* **Primary Distribution:** 11 kV to 33 kV (feeder lines running down main streets).
* **Secondary Distribution:** 120V, 240V, or 400V (what actually enters your home).

#### **4. Loads (The Consumers)**
The end-users.
* **Industrial:** Motors, heavy machinery (often require three-phase power).
* **Residential:** Lighting, heating, electronics (usually single-phase power).

### **Lecture Module 2: The "Why" — Transmission Economics**

A common question is: *Why do we need big transformers? Why can't we just transmit electricity at the generated voltage?*

The answer lies in **Joules Law of Heating**.

When current flows through a conductor, power is lost as heat. The power loss ($P_{loss}$) in a transmission line is given by:

$$P_{loss} = I^2 R$$

Where:
* $I$ = Current (Amperes)
* $R$ = Resistance of the wire (Ohms)

However, the power ($P$) we want to deliver to the customer is roughly:

$$P \approx V I$$

* $V$ = Voltage
* $I$ = Current

**The Professor's Logic:**
If we want to deliver a fixed amount of Power ($P$) to a city, we have two choices:
1.  Increase Current ($I$) and keep Voltage ($V$) low.
2.  Increase Voltage ($V$) and keep Current ($I$) low.

If we choose option 1 (high current), the losses ($I^2 R$) grow exponentially. If we double the current, losses quadruple. Therefore, to transmit power efficiently over long distances, we **must minimize current**. To keep power constant while minimizing current, we **must maximize voltage**.

> **Key Takeaway:** We step up voltage to reduce current, which drastically reduces transmission line losses.

This requirement is why **Transformers** are the heart of the AC power system. They allow us to easily shift between high voltage for transmission and low voltage for safety.

### **Lecture Module 3: AC vs. DC and Phases**

#### **The War of Currents**
Historically, Thomas Edison advocated for Direct Current (DC), while Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse advocated for Alternating Current (AC).
* **Why AC won (initially):** The invention of the transformer made it easy to step voltage up and down. DC could not be easily transformed at that time.
* **The Return of DC:** Today, **High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)** is making a comeback for very long distances (undersea cables, inter-continental ties) because it suffers fewer losses than AC over extreme distances.

#### **Why Three-Phase?**
You will notice transmission towers usually have wires in multiples of three.
* **Single-Phase:** Like a piston in an engine, power delivery pulses (goes to zero twice per cycle).
* **Three-Phase:** Three sine waves offset by $120^{\circ}$. The total power delivery is constant and smooth, which is much better for large motors and generators. It is also more material-efficient than single-phase.

### **Lecture Module 4: The Modern Challenge**

The grid was designed for a one-way flow:
$$Generator \rightarrow Transmission \rightarrow Distribution \rightarrow Home$$

However, the grid is changing. With rooftop solar and electric vehicles (EVs), homes are now generating power and sending it *back* to the grid.

**Course Objective:**
In this course, we will learn how to model these systems, calculate power flows, understand fault currents (short circuits), and analyze the stability of this massive machine.

### **Classroom Material: Student Handout**

**Course:** EE 301 - Power Systems I
**Topic:** Introduction & Basic Structure

**Definitions to Remember:**
| Term | Definition | Typical Voltage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Generation** | Conversion of primary energy to electricity. | 11 kV - 25 kV |
| **Step-up Transformer** | Increases voltage for transmission to reduce $I^2R$ losses. | Low $\rightarrow$ High |
| **Transmission** | Bulk transfer of power over long distances. | 110 kV - 765 kV |
| **Distribution** | Final delivery to end-users. | 400V - 33 kV |
| **Busbar** | A connection point (node) for lines and equipment. | N/A |

**Discussion Question for Next Class:**
If we increase the transmission voltage, we reduce line losses. So, why don't we just transmit at 10 million volts? What is the limiting factor? (Hint: Think about what happens to air when electrical pressure gets too high).

### **Next Step for You**
Would you like me to generate a practice problem set involving **Power Loss calculations ($I^2R$)** to help the students grasp the importance of high-voltage transmission?
